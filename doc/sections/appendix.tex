\section{Additional Results from Chapter 3 Case Study 1}

This appendix recreates Figures \ref{fig:sens_spec} and \ref{fig:viterbi_dives_D26b} from the first case study of Chapter 3 for $\alpha = 0,0.025,0.049,0.525,1$. The results for $\alpha = 0.025$ and $\alpha = 0.525$ are very similar to those for $\alpha = 0.049$, but I include them here for completeness.

    \caption[Sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values associated with each dive type from the first case study.]{Sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values associated with each dive type. True values are determined via the drone-detected dive types. The PHMMs for each value of $\alpha$ were fit using the entire dataset with a selected sub-profile held out. Then, the dives for that sub-profile were estimated by using the forward-backward algorithm on the sub-profile with the drone-detected labels removed. I repeated this process for every sub-profile to get a full set of estimated dive types.}
